Changelog
=========

------
v 0.18
------

+ Client-side component dependencies can be requested using the ``js/path/file_without_extension``
  convention (example: ``js/file``, ``js/lib/file``). The previous way of requesting js files
  (``/component/optional_version/js/file.js``) still works but it's not recommended.
+ Removed the ``util`` shortcut from the RequireJS paths. In order to use the ``util`` library you
  should request it using ``raintime/lib/util``.
+ Fixed a bug where a component added to the page using ``context.insert`` could not be found.
